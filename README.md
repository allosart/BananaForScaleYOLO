Test notebook based on: [notebooks/230-yolov8-optimization/230-yolov8-optimization.ipynb](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/230-yolov8-optimization/230-yolov8-optimization.ipynb)

# Idea

Detect the banana in the picture and use its bounding box to estimate size of other detected objects.
Banana for scale is the best way to measure the size of things... when you only have a banana available.
